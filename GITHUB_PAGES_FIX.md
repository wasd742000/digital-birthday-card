# GitHub Pages Deployment Checklist ✅

## Files Fixed for GitHub Pages

### ✅ Service Worker Issues Fixed
- [x] Changed service worker registration from `/sw.js` to `./sw.js` in main.js
- [x] Updated all cache URLs in sw.js to use relative paths (`./*` instead of `/*`)
- [x] Added `.nojekyll` file to prevent Jekyll conflicts

### ✅ Image Loading Issues Fixed  
- [x] Added support for simple numbered files (1.png, 2.png, etc.) which exist in your assets/images/ folder
- [x] Enhanced generateCommonNames() to prioritize numbered files
- [x] Modified loadAllMedia() to specifically load known images (1.png through 14.png)

### ✅ Path Issues Fixed
- [x] All paths in HTML are already relative (css/, js/, assets/)
- [x] Service worker cache URLs updated to relative paths
- [x] Image and video loading uses relative paths

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and push your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix GitHub Pages deployment issues"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" section
   - Select "Deploy from a branch" → main branch
   - Save settings

3. **Test your site:**
   - Visit `https://wasd742000.github.io/[your-repo-name]`
   - Check browser console (F12) for any remaining errors
   - Verify images are loading (numbered images 1.png through 14.png should work)
   - Verify service worker registers without 404 errors

## Expected Results

- ✅ Service worker should register without 404 errors
- ✅ Images 1.png through 14.png should appear as floating elements
- ✅ No more "sw.js 404" errors in browser console
- ✅ Site should work properly on GitHub Pages subdirectory

## If Issues Persist

1. Check the browser console (F12) for any new error messages
2. Verify the repository is public
3. Wait 5-10 minutes after enabling GitHub Pages
4. Clear browser cache and reload the page
